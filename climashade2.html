                        This project was a part of the Buckylab course around October 2022 to January 2023 (See the blog <a class="bucky" href="https://buckylab.blogspot.com/">here</a>).
                        <br><br>
                        That year the objective of the course was all about creating and designing a Convertible Urban Sunshade. CUS for short. Convertible as in it would be able to adapt itself to different circumstances (night and day for example), Urban as it had to be situated in a city like environment as these areas tend to get quite hot during the summer so a relief of some shade is definitely beneficial. All in all creating a design that will create cooler spots in public spaces.
                        <br><br>
                        The course was all about designing and prototyping. Hence why we in one of the last weeks before the final presentations were given the opportunity to make our design reality by creating a first 1:1 prototype. One week we were given the time and resources to make that happen. An array of tools as well as materials at our disposal.

                <span id="text2">
                    Our solution became Climashade. The rapid increase in record temperatures in urban areas, particularly during the summer,
                    has become a significant concern due to the effects of climate change. In certain cities, the
                    absence of wind exacerbates this issue. To combat these conditions, we opted with our design to use the concept of a <a class="solarchimney" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_chimney">solarchimney</a>. Creating convection at the hand of a pressure difference created by the difference in temperature between in our case the top and bottom of the canopy. Not only providing shade but a cool breeze as well by leading the air through openings in the canopy blades. 
                    <br><br><br>

                    </div> 
                    <br><br>
                    The top transparent layer would then catch the solar radiation warming the space between the bottom insulating and shading layer and the transparent one creating a high pressure area. This air cavity is open both on top as well as on eye level which allows the air from below to seep through to the top to the higher pressure creating a draft.   
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="conceptimg">

                    <br>
                    On top of that four of the 8 blades would be able to rotate to open the canopy at night to let the night air and radiation of the sky cool the area underneath down as much as possible until the sun would rise once more and it would close back up again to provide shade and a cool breeze.

        <!---The experiment--->
        <div class="experiment" id="experiment">
            <div class="expcontainer">
                <h1>The experiment</h1>
                <span id="text3">
                    To prove the concept of the Climashade, of basically creating a solar chimney on a very small scale, and see if it worked as effectively as we wanted (creating a draft of 0.8 m/s) we tested our concept as seen below.
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="expimg">
                        <img class="exp" id="expmodel" src="Images/Screenshot 2024-06-12 123149.jpg" alt="Image 4">
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    The experiment was based on a similar test with a simple paper tube and a heat lamp. We created a similar setup with a scale model of the canopy instead of the paper tube seeing if a draft can be created by the heat difference with our design. Instead of a fan we enclosed our model in a box, filling it with smoke to visually see the change in draft between no 'sun' and 'sun'. To measure the change and temperature difference between top and bottom we used an anemometer.                    <br><br>
                    <div class="expimg">
                        <img class="exp" id="expsetup" src="Images/Screenshot 2024-06-12 123258.jpg" alt="Image 5">  
                    </div>
                    <br><br>
                    The result as seen below proved that with our concept we would be able to create a draft of wind and create  a cooler environment under the canopy.

        <!---Model-->
        <div class="model" id="model">
            <div class="modelcontainer">
                <h1>The Model</h1>
                <span id="text4">
                    The last thing to do was to create more prototypes refining our design for the canopy and figure out by experimenting, drawing and trial and error what works best. Down below is one of our first design ideas. The idea was to create 8 ribs that could pull fabric/ transparent sheeting along to open and close the canopy.                    <br><br><br>
                    <div class="modimg">
                        <img class="mod" id="moddraw" src="Images/turn.jpg" alt="Image 4">  
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    This we tested with our scale model. This gave us an insight that instead of having 8 ribs pulling fabric along when opened might be a challenge structurally as they would easily bend by the force of the pulling fabric and hopped over to a design like we ended up with, with 8 blades instead with only 4 moving and making the blades themselves stiff instead of their ribs.                    <br><br>
                    <div class="modimg">
                        <img class="mod" id="modmodel" src="Images/model.jpg" alt="Image 4">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    So eventually we came to the point where we decided to test our design on a 1:1 scale. Mainly to see if the rotating mechanism based on basically one big ball bearing would with the weight of the canopy still run as smoothly as intended. We were given a week, and an array of tools and materials to build the model. One tool we excessively used throughout the week was the milling machine to create the round bearing from wooden plates. The result, a 1:1 prototype demonstrating both the rotating mechanism as well as the double layered blades of the canopy.                    <br><br>
