                <span id="text">
                    <br>
                    The technology design course was an engaging introduction to the role of robotics in architecture. In a group with Shrotria Shashvat and Jean Ong, we designed the Wildreed Observatory, a "Camouflage Nest" for nature and wildlife observation in the Nationaal Park Hollandse Duinen.
                    <br><br>
                    Our task was to create a camouflaged hideout, integrating seamlessly into the environment and protected from the elements. The structure had to be built using robotics, with a limited set of discrete building elements, and a footprint no larger than 6x6 meters and a height not exceeding 4 meters. We focused on sustainability and cleverly concealed entrances, exits, and viewing openings.
                    <br><br>
                    We also created two models using a robotic arm. The first was an Assembly Prototype, demonstrating detailed assembly and joint solutions at scales like 1:1, 1:2, or 1:5. The second was a Construction Model, showing the overall building in context at scales like 1:10 or 1:20.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout the course, we optimized production time and resources, culminating in a four-hour slot to build the final models with the robotic arm. The project aimed to blend nature and technology, creating a sanctuary that connects people with the natural world while leaving no trace.

                <h1 class="concept-heading"> The concept</h1>
                <span id="text2">
                    The aim was to create a structure that seamlessly blends into the natural surroundings,
                    providing a space for the wildlife spotter that is both functional and discrete. We did so by using the contours of the landscape and the appearance of the local flora as inspiration,
                    the hideout becoming an extension of the environment, rather than a disruptive
                    presence.
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="conimgcontainer">
                        <img class ="conimg" src="Images/Screenshot 2024-06-23 174431.jpg"> 
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    The concept for the nature and wildlife observation hideout therefore started out as two surfaces that smoothly curve and flow around each other, forming a geometry of synclastic and anticlastic curvatures. This geometry will have a single face and will enclose observation spaces in between them. The design elements mimicking the appearance of the wild grass present in the surrounding environment, while also following the contours and curves of the surfaces of the dunes. The free-flowing, curved surfaces will allow for a unique and immersive experience, with observation spaces that offer a panoramic view of the natural world. Even in materialization it mimics the same wild grass appearance as the discrete elements are made from reeds originating from the same area.

                    <br>
                    The packing of reeds consists of an outer layer of reeds, taped together to maintain
                    the rectilinear shape of the member and to make it easily detachable for maintenance.
                    The outer layer can be replaced to keep the inner reeds from degrading overtime. The bundles are then fitted into the joints using bio-based adhesives.
                    <br><br>

                    </div>
                    <br>
                    The overall structure is made with a combination of 2 unique discrete elements. (1) is primarily used as a knee brace for the base of the ribs while (2) is repeated across the rest of the structure to create the form. The use of reeds is strategic here, considering our siteâ€™s proximity to reed habitats and the fact that they are also biodegradable. When bundled up, they make a strong structure that is often used in some communities to construct shelter.
                    <br><br>

                    <br>
                    Joints were designed to both connect and remain in place and to be picked up without moving from position. There are 3 unique pieces to the joinery. The in-built gears also allow 20 different angles of variations, giving us more freedom in our form and the ability to create the eventual wavy form of the entire structure. 
                    <br><br>

                    </div>
                    <br>
                    As for the entire process from building the elements to the eventual build we opted to go for a collaboration between humans and robotics. The reeds are harvested and the discrete joints fabricated in a factory setting, as well as the preparation of the reeds to eventually create the entire element. With the help of a robot arm in an industrial setting the pieces will be linked together at the right angle and locked using the cylinder locks by hand. Once the rib is ready it is shipped and then brought to site where the individual ribs can be installed.
